This program will walk the directory it is run in and create a file
containing a list of all subdirectories and files.

This program is an exercise to learn how to use os.walk and other 
Python features with an eye to including them in future projects.

Future plans for this program include figuring out how to better 
organize the results, adding more information, and perhaps allowing
the user to specify a directory when running on the command line.
